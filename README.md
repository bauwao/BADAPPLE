# BADAPPLE
A redstone MLP neural network that uses MSE learn to predict my channel views.
BADAPPLE stands for "B Ack Pro Pogation D Artificial int L Eligence."

(I remember last time I accidentally broke it, so I'm not sure if it's still working.)

### How to use this file?
Throw the entire "BADAPPLE/BADAPPLE" folder (i.e., the BADAPPLE directory and the file inside) into the "saves/" folder.
(Game version: 1.18.2)
